This test database has been created during several years since 2011. Most
of the tests have been constructed by members of the GeoGebra Team
including Csilla Solyom-Gecse and Zoltan Kovacs with the help of Tomas
Recio's, Franisco Botana's, Miguel A. Abanades', Simon Weitzhofer's,
Damien Desfontaines', Predrag Janicic's and Ivan Petrovic's.

Many tests are simply taken from Chou's 1988 book "Mechanical Geometry
Theorem Proving", but in some cases the labels in the constructions have
been changed. Their test names always contain an "ex-..." part which
describes the example number in Chou's book.

In some other tests the abbreviated names of other contributors have been
used. They include AL (Andreas Lindner, Linz, Austria) and JH (Josef
Hayboeck, Linz, Austria).

Despite the fact that some tests seem to be present multiple times in
different formulations, these occurences are still useful to check various
ways for entering the theorem in GeoGebra.
